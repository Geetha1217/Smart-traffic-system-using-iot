Traffic congestion is a major problem in many cities of India along with other countries. Failure 
of signals, poor law enforcement and bad traffic management are major reasons. With the rapid 
growth of population in metropolitan cities, traffic congestion is often seen. Traffic congestion 
has a negative impact on economy, the environment and the overall quality of life. Hence it is 
high time to effectively manage the traffic congestion problem. There are various methods 
available for traffic congestion management. In order to resolve this issue, a smart traffic 
management system using Internet of Things (IOT) is introduced. This technology can act as a 
key to smart traffic management in real time. This new technology which will require less time 
for installation with lesser costs as compared to other methods of traffic congestion 
management. Use of this new technology with the suitable algorithm will lead to reduce and 
manage traffic congestion efficiently. For this purpose, the system takes the density of traffic 
as an input from cameras, sensors and manages traffic signals. Another algorithm based on 
Artificial Intelligence is used to predict the traffic density for future to minimize the traffic 
flow on roads. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this hybrid traffic management system, a 
prototype is developed which not only optimizes the flow of traffic but also contacts nearby 
rescue departments with a centralized server. Moreover, it also extracts useful information 
presented in graphical formats that may help the authorities in future road planning
